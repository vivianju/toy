            <h2> Sypnosis </h2>
            <p> Woody and the gang go on a road trip with new toy Forky, who's convinced he's trash and doesn't yet
                understand his role in the world. Along the way, Woody is unexpectedly reunited with independent spirit
                Bo Peep and finds himself faced with a decision, and a future, he never imagined.

                    <p> He is a vintage cowboy doll that originally belonged to a boy named Andy Davis. As Andy's
                        favorite since kindergarten, Woody served as the leader of Andy's toys, a position he upheld by
                        looking out for each member of the group. When Andy enters adulthood and leaves for college,
                        Woody is donated to a little girl named Bonnie Anderson. He remains with Bonnie for some time,
                        before choosing to become an owner-less antique devoted to helping lost toys find owners,
                        alongside his girlfriend Bo Peep.</p>

                    <p> Played by <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000741/"> Tim Allen </a> </p> <br>
                    <p> He is a spaceman action figure originally belonging to Andy Davis. Buzz was created during a
                        time where astronauts were especially popular amongst children. His arrival in the original Toy
                        Story created conflict with Andy's favorite toy Sheriff Woody, though this rivalry would
                        eventually blossom into a lifelong friendship.

                    <p> Played by <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0355024/"> Tony Hale </a> </p> <br>
                    <p> An actual spork-turned-craft-project, Forky is pretty sure that he doesn’t belong in Bonnie's
                        room. Unfortunately, every time he tries to get away, Woody yanks him back into an adventure
                        he’d rather skip. Forky is a toy that Bonnie made out of a disposable spork, so he’s facing a
                        crisis. He wants to fulfill his purpose as a spork, but now has a new toy purpose thrust upon
                        him.”

                    <p> Bo is the romantic interest (later girlfriend) of Woody, providing a calm and loving comfort
                        whenever he is overwhelmed. She is noted for using her shepherdess crook to hook her cowboy and
                        bring him closer in a romantic way. In private, she is a great deal more daring with her words
                        and actions, which Woody seems to be quite fond of. She and her sheep were bought along with the
                        lamp not too long after Molly was born, due to the baby being scared of the dark, which "broke
                        every toy's heart", according to Woody. The lamp comforted Molly and she would often have her
                        hand lay on Bo's feet.
